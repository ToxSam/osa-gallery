# About

Learn about the technologies and philosophy behind Open Source Avatars.

## Our Mission

Open Source Avatars is dedicated to providing free, accessible, and high-quality 3D avatars for everyone. We believe in open standards, decentralized storage, and the power of community-driven content.

## Technologies We Use

We leverage modern technologies to ensure avatars are accessible, permanent, and compatible across platforms:

- **VRM Format**: A universal 3D avatar format that works across multiple platforms
- **Decentralized Storage**: Permanent storage on Arweave and IPFS ensures avatars are always available
- **Open Standards**: We use open formats and standards, not proprietary solutions

## Our Philosophy

We're committed to open source principles. Most of our avatars use CC0 (Public Domain) licensing, meaning you can use them however you want without attribution. Some collections use CC-BY, which requires attribution but still allows commercial use.
