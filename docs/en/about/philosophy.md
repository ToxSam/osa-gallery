# Open Source Philosophy

We believe avatars should be free and accessible.

That's why our original collections are CC0 (public domain):

- ✅ Use in commercial projects
- ✅ Modify and remix freely
- ✅ No attribution required
- ✅ Train AI models
- ✅ Use in games, apps, artwork

Community collections have their own licenses - we make these easy to find so you know exactly what you can do with each avatar.

The metaverse should be built on open standards, not locked behind paywalls.
