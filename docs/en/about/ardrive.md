# What is ArDrive?

ArDrive is permanent, decentralized storage built on Arweave.

## Why it matters:

- Files stored forever (can't be deleted or taken offline)
- One-time payment, no subscriptions
- Perfect for preserving open source content

Our original avatars (100Avatars series) are stored on ArDrive to ensure they're always available, no matter what happens to this website.
