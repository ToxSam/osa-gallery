# Avatar Collections

Welcome to the Avatar Collections section! This site hosts multiple avatar collections with different licenses and sources, all designed to be free and accessible for your projects.

## Overview

Open Source Avatars features both original collections created by ToxSam and community collections from talented creators. All collections are carefully curated to ensure quality and compatibility across platforms.

## Collection Types

- **Original Collections**: The 100Avatars series (R1, R2, R3) with 300 free avatars
- **Community Collections**: Curated collections from various creators, all using open licenses

## Licensing

Most collections use **CC0 (Public Domain)** licensing, meaning you can use them however you want without attribution. Some collections use **CC-BY** licensing, which requires attribution but still allows commercial use. Check each collection's details for specific licensing information.
